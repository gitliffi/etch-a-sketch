# etch-a-sketch

This project took me a long time to finish, not because of its complexity but due to my own laziness and getting sidetracked by the Google Python course. The end 
result is a little buggy, and I decided against doing the optional objective since I couldn't really solve the issue of switching out the mouseover event conditions
from black to colour. It works as it is and I'm gona leave it and move on to other projects.
